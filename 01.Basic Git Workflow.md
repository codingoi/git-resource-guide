Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

## git init

```
git init

```
The word init means initialize. 

## Git Workflow

Nice! We have a Git project. A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project
The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository. In Git, we save changes with a commit.

## git status

You can check the status of those changes with:

```
git status

```

Untracked Files: Untracked means that Git sees the file but has not started tracking changes yet.

## git add
In order for Git to start tracking scene-1.txt, the file needs to be added to the staging area.

We can add a file to the staging area with:

```
git add filename

```
The word filename here refers to the name of the file you are editing


## git diff

Since the file is tracked, we can check the differences between the working directory and the staging area with:

```
git diff filename

```

Here, filename is the actual name of the file. If the name of my file was changes.txt the command would be

```
git diff changes.txt

```
Changes to the file are marked with a + and are indicated in green


## git commit

A commit is the last step in our Git workflow. A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.

git commit is the command we’ll do next. However, one more bit of code is needed for a commit: the option -m followed by a message. Here’s an example:

```
git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"
```

Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:
 
- Must be in quotation marks
- Written in the present tense
- Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using -m


## git log

Often with Git, you’ll need to refer back to an earlier version of a project. Commits are stored chronologically in the repository and can be viewed with:

```
git log
```
